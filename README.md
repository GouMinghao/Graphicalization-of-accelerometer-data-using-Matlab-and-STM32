# Graphicalization-of-accelerometer-MPU9250-data-using-Matlab-and-STM32
STM32 communicates with MPU-9250 9-axis accelerometer using and Matlab communicates with STM32 using Serial communication. Then the graphicalization of data

# STM32 Code
C code in the directory.  
Configuration of the program needs to be done according to the type of MCU. After Configuration, you can copy the C code in to the directory. Finally you can compile the program using Keil.

# Matlab Code
Run SerialInit.m to begin receiving information.  
Type in kill to stop the program.

# Thanks
Yuqiu Huang（黄宇秋）also contributes a lot to this program.
